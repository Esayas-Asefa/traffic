# Project Traffic

Predict the impact a traffic accident will have on traffic flow.

### Project Description

There are hundreds of thousands of vehicle accidents in Texas and California, some traffic incidents have greater impacts on traffic flow than others. Many factors may contribute to the impact a traffic accident may have on traffic flow to include specific locations, features of the road, and/or weather conditions. If the impact of traffic accidents can be predictable based on these features then local authorities may have a better idea on where to place emergency resources and how to plan road renovations.

### Project Goal

* Discover what drives the impact on traffic flow from accidents
* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to predict severity
* This information could be used to further our understanding of traffic flow

### Initial Thoughts

My initial hypothesis is that drivers of severity will be most strongly associated with zip codes and weather conditions.

## The Plan

* Acquire data from kaggle.com
  * Create a dataframe from the csv I downloaded from kaggle.com
* Prepare data
  * Create Engineered columns from existing data
  * Get rid of columns that probably don't have significant impact on severity
  * Dealt with null values
* Explore data in search of drivers of severity
  * Answer the following initial questions
    * Is there a correlation between zipcode and severity?
    * Is there a correlation visibility and severity?
    * Is there a correlation between the day of week and severity?
    * Is there a difference in average average severity between zipcodes?
* Develop a Model to predict property value
  * Use drivers identified in explore to help build predictive models of different types
  * Evaluate models on train and validate data
  * Select the best model based on $RMSE$ and $R^2$
  * Evaluate the best model on test data
* Draw conclusions

# Conclusions

#### Takeaways and Key Findings

* The younger the property the better for property value
* The bigger the living area the bigger the property value
* Location matters for property value
* Model still needs improvement

### Recommendations and Next Steps

* It would nice to have the data to check if the included appliances or the type of heating services (gas or electric) of the property would affect property value
* More time is needed to work on features to better improve the model
    - latitude and longitude could hopefully give insights into cities and neighborhoods with higher or lower property values
    - pools and garages could also be looked into
